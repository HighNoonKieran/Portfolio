            <h2>I grew up in Drumheller</h2>
            <p>While growing up I liked to spend time <strong>hiking</strong>, playing <strong>video games</strong>, and watching <strong>tv & movies</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <p>I have only become really interested in hiking in the last few years and the coolest place that I have hiked is definitely the <i>Alps</i> in Germany!</p>
